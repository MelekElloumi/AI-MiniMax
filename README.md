# Artificial Intelligence : MiniMax Algorithm 

- This is a modelisation of a NIM game which we apply Minimax algorithm to solve it and play against the computer.
- It can show the number of visited states using minimax with and without alpha-beta settingh.
- You can play against the computer and choose your own moves. The computer choice is optimised with minimax. The first player is chosen by random.
- The chosen NIM game is to take a number and divide to 1s and 2s. The player who can't make any move loses.
